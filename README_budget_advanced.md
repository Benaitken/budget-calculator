Budget Calculator - Advanced Version

This is the advanced version of a simple budget calculator written in Python.  
It stores incomes and expenses in a JSON file so your data is saved between program runs.
 
 How it Works
1. Add income or expenses using the program menu.  
2. The program automatically saves the data to `budget_data_advanced.json`.  
3. When you run the program again, it loads your previous data so your balance persists.
