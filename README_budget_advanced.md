Budget Calculator - Advanced Version

This is the advanced version of a simple budget calculator written in Python.  
It stores incomes and expenses in a JSON file so your data is saved between program runs.
 
 How it Works
1. Add income or expenses using the program menu.  
2. The program automatically saves the data to budget_data_advanced.json.  
3. When you run the program again, it loads your previous data so your balance persists.
